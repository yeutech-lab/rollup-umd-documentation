You can override any style variable thanks to `bootstrap-styled`.

All you need to care is:
 
* `theme` folder in `src` at the root of any rollup-umd project:
   * `index.js` is the main theme where you can override any `bootstrap-styled` variable.
   * `styleguidist-bs/index.js` is the `styleguidist` theme where you can override variable for every component used in this library.
